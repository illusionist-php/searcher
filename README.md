## âœ¨ Features

- Zero configuration
- Compatible with [laravel/scout](https://github.com/laravel/scout) and [lorisleiva/laravel-search-string](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-search-string)
- Support string and array [syntax](#syntax)
- Support [laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework) framework
- Support [thinkphp](https://github.com/top-think/think) framework

## ðŸ“¦ Install

install via composer

```bash
composer require illusionist/searcher
```

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

Add the `Searchable` trait to your model's

```php
<?php

namnespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illusionist\Searcher\Eloquent\Searchable;

class Article extends Model
{
    use Searchable;
}
```

Now you can create a database query using the [search syntax](#syntax)

```php
Article::search('title:"Hello world" sort:-created_at,published')->get();
```

## <a id="syntax"></a> ðŸ’¡ Syntax

Note that the spaces between operators don't matter for the string syntax

### Exact matches

**String syntax**

```php
'rating: 0'
'rating = 0'
'title: Hello'               // Strings without spaces do not need quotes
'title: "Hello World"'       // Strings with spaces require quotes
"title: 'Hello World'"       // Single quotes can be used too
'rating = 99.99'
'created_at: "2018-07-06 00:00:00"'
```

**Array syntax**

```php
['rating' => 0]
['title' => 'Hello World']
['rating' => 99.99]
['created_at' => '2018-07-06 00:00:00']
```

### Comparisons

**String syntax**

```php
'title < B'
'rating > 3'
'created_at >= "2018-07-06 00:00:00"'
```

**Array syntax**

```php
['title' => ['<', 'B']]
['rating' => ['>', 3]]
['created_at' => ['>=', '2018-07-06 00:00:00']]
```

### Booleans

**String syntax**

```php
'published'         // published = true
'not published'     // published = false
```

**Array syntax**

```php
['published']              // published = true
['not' => 'created_at']    // published = false
```

### Dates

**String syntax**

```php
'created_at'                            // created_at is not null
'not created_at'                        // created_at is null

// Year precision
'created_at >= 2020'                    // 2020-01-01 00:00:00 <= created_at

'not created_at = 2020'                 // created_at < 2020-01-01 00:00:00 and created_at > 2020-12-31 23:59:59

'comments.author: (name: John)'         // Same as before
'comments.author.name: John'            // Same as before

// Nested relationships are optimised
'comments.author.name: John and comments.author.age > 21'   // Same as: 'comments: (author: (name: John and age > 21))
